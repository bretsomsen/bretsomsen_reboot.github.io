          <h3>Where I'm at and where I've been:</h3>
          <p>My professional career began with spending 15 years in the bar/hospitality industry. Four years ago, I decided to make a change and went to Alaska and spent four seasons as a commercial salmon fisherman. I graduated Bainbridge Island High School in 1997; in 2012 I received an Associates of Arts Transfer Degree from Portland Community College. Starting on December 18, 2017, there is a 16 week 'Boot Camp' course at Portland Code Guild that I plan on attending. I've completed an 'Intro to Frontend' course at PCG and I'm currently taking an 'Intro to Programming' course, also at PCG. I am very excited at a career in the tech industry.</p>

          <h3>Why Reboot NW and Me?</h3>
          <p>About a month and a half ago I was having a conversation with a friend of mine, who is a web-developer, about learning how to code. I was talking about how I had been interested for some time, about the idea that it would be interesting to learn how to learn the coding language. I was speaking as if this would be an interesting task to take on as a hobby, and my friend told me that I might look into coding as a career</p>
          <p>The next few weeks went by really quickly. I found myself making contact with Sheri Dover over at Portland Code Guild and quickly getting involved in an Intro to Front-end course, at PCG. This would be a litmus test. Things would go one of two ways, I would either be thwarted by the attempt, or my enthusiasm would be amplified. I found that the flames of my enthusiasm were fanned by the experience, even more excited about the prospect than I had been at the outset of the endeavour! I thanked Sheri for the opportunity, then she signed me up for an Intro to Programming course, and she also turned me on to the potential resources of Reboot NW. I am eagerly soaking up as much information as I can before the winter 'Boot Camp' starts at PCG on December 18th. I feel like the resources of Reboot NW and my interests align perfectly, and would be an invaluable asset moving forward in hot pursuit of this new dream!

            <h3 class='examples'>Links to Frontend Labs using CSS:</h3>
            <p>As a reference of some of the work I've done in frontend development, I've attached links to examples frontend pages that I've formatted using CSS. The content for these projects were given in HTML, and the design elements you see were accomplished using CSS only. The third link is the very first web-site that I ever put together, so be kind with your judgement! (This little mock-up that your looking at today is web-site #2!!)</p>

            <h3>Home grown in the PNW, I moved to PDX from Seattle in the fall of 2007:</h3>
            <p>My family moved from the mid-west when I was just 12 back in 1991, and we landed on a small island in the Puget Sound called Bainbridge. I've alway's enjoyed the outdoors, and after a brief stint in Boulder, CO, from 1997-2001, I moved back to Seattle and began a 15 year run in the hospitality industry. This was an extremely positive experience, growing a large skill-set in customer service and gaining an ability to connect with a wide range of people, from all walks of life. In the fall of 2007 I relocated to PDX and really have not looked back since. In the spring of 2014 I began working in the commercial fishing industry as a deck-hand on the F/V Constance. That has been an amazing experience, feeding my love for the outdoors and really growing an already strong work ethic. Peppered into my first few years in Portland I attended classes at Portland Community College, working on an Associate's Degree of Transfer, with the intention of going on to Portland State University to pursue a career in the health care industry. I've always had a love for math and science. In the last 1 1/2 years I began to show an interest in the world of technology science which has led me to the present. I know a number of family/friends in the field of data science and one of my close friends has his own web-development company, with whom I've had many conversations about the possibilities in the field. He is the one that has led me to the doorstep of Portland Code Guild, and Sheri Dover. After taking an Intro to Frontend course, as well as being enrolled in an Intro to Programming course there, I learned of the Reboot NW program. As I fall into the category of all three criteria to apply for the program, I am extremely hopeful to be a part of the Reboot program. I definitely feel that the goals of Reboot align well with my own personal goals. And I am very excited about the endless possibilities in tech!
